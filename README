NAME
    Syntax::Feature::Simple - DWIM syntax extensions

VERSION
    version 0.001

DESCRIPTION
    This is a more of a syntax extension package than a simple extension by
    itself. It will detect what kind of package it is imported into, and
    setup appropriate syntax extensions depending on the type.

    See Syntax::Feature::Simple::V1 for the first version of the extension
    set.

SEE ALSO
